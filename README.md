# What is a Cone/Frustum? (from Wikipedia)
In  [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a  **frustum**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustum#endnote_1)  (plural:  _frusta_  or  _frustums_) is the portion of a  [solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron")  (normally a  [cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry) "Cone (geometry)")  or  [pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(geometry) "Pyramid (geometry)")) that lies between one or two  [parallel planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_planes "Parallel planes")  cutting it. A  **right frustum**  is a parallel  [truncation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_(geometry) "Truncation (geometry)")  of a  [right pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_pyramid "Right pyramid")  or right cone.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustum#cite_note-1)

In  [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics")  the  [viewing frustum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum "Viewing frustum")  is the three-dimensional region which is visible on the screen. It is formed by a  [clipped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(computer_graphics) "Clipping (computer graphics)")  pyramid; in particular,  _[frustum culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustum_culling "Frustum culling")_  is a method of  [hidden surface determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_surface_determination "Hidden surface determination").

In the  [aerospace industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_industry "Aerospace industry"), a frustum is the  [fairing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_fairing "Payload fairing")  between two stages of a  [multistage rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket "Multistage rocket")  (such as the  [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V "Saturn V")), which is shaped like a  [truncated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_(geometry) "Truncation (geometry)")  cone.

If  [all the edges are forced to be identical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotoxal_figure "Isotoxal figure"), a frustum becomes a uniform  [prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(geometry) "Prism (geometry)").

## Introduction
Conebot is a **multi-functional** Discord bot that performs various functions, whether administrative or mathematical. The first ~~victim~~ server he inhabits welcomes all frustum fans (below).

[Server](https://discord.gg/n4QmcCc)
## Mathematical - It's Math.
It performs simplistic **mathematical functions**, including but not limited to:
- !circlecircum
- !divide
- !circlearea

## Miscellaneous - Quality o' Life.
Discord, being the hip and edgy website that it is, needs some funny commands. I mean sheesh, what are we? **Skype?** Commands include quality of life functions such as a reminder command, or just something fun.
- !8ball
- !remindme

## Administrative - For the Big Brother in all of us.
Executes various administrative functions, such as counting the hours the bot has been online and monitoring certain ban words.
## Conclusion
This was a fun project for me to do. Honestly, I'm bit of an amateur at Python (I know, right?) I'm trying to learn on my free time and this was the culmination of my efforts :^)

Use Conebot at your own discrepancy. I mean, you have control of my token and stuff. Be nice! 

Follow me on my [website](http://tanchris.com/). I do blogs, writing, etc. if you care about that stuff. Thanks for reading.
